gox \- gox
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gox
[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,packages\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IP
Gox cross\-compiles Go applications in parallel.
.IP
If no specific operating systes or architectures are specified, Gox
will build for all pairs supported by your version of Go.

.PP
Output path template:
.IP
The output path for the compiled binaries is specified with the
"\-output" flag. The value is a string that is a Go text template.
The default value is "{{.Dir}}_{{.OS}}_{{.Arch}}". The variables and
their values should be self\-explanatory.
.PP
Platforms (OS/Arch):
.IP
The operating systems and architectures to cross\-compile for may be
specified with the "\-arch" and "\-os" flags. These are space separated lists
of valid GOOS/GOARCH values to build for, respectively. You may prefix an
OS or Arch with "!" to negate and not build for that platform. If the list
is made up of only negations, then the negations will come from the default
list.
.IP
Additionally, the "\-osarch" flag may be used to specify complete os/arch
pairs that should be built or ignored. The syntax for this is what you would
expect: "darwin/amd64" would be a valid osarch value. Multiple can be space
separated. An os/arch pair can begin with "!" to not build for that platform.
.IP
The "\-osarch" flag has the highest precedent when determing whether to
build for a platform. If it is included in the "\-osarch" list, it will be
built even if the specific os and arch is negated in "\-os" and "\-arch",
respectively.
